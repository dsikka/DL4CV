This will involve processing the data to be in a useable form, training the model, and applying fine-tuning as necessary. The classification accuracy of the model will then be assessed."

I would like to first do this for 5-class classification problem (i.e. only use a subset of the data) and then repeat this process for a 15 class, classification problem. If the second part is sucessfull, I would compare the model trained in Goal#1."
